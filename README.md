# **Distributed Systems Lab ðŸš€**  

Unlock the power of **distributed computing** with hands-on labs! This repository provides **practical implementations** of Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and Socket Programming, allowing you to build real-world client-server applications. Whether you're a **student, researcher, or developer**, this lab is designed to help you master distributed systems through coding.
